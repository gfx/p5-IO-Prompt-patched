IO::Prompt version 0.997001

By default, this module exports a single function: prompt().  It prompts the
user to enter some input, and returns an object that represents the user input.

You may specify various flags to the function to affect its behaviour; most
notably, it defaults to automatically chomp the input, unless the -line
flag is specified.

Note that this is an interim re-release. A full release with better
documentation will follow in the near future. Meanwhile, please consult
the 'examples/' directory from this module's CPAN distribution to better
understand how to make use of this module.
